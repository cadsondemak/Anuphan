# Anuphan: A Cadson Demak version of IBM Plex Thai (Loopless)

IBM Plex is an international typeface family with four subfamilies (Sans, Sans Condensed, Serif, and Mono), eight weights and two styles (Roman & Italic). This open-source, corporate typeface is developed by Mike Abbink and Bold Monday.

Anuphan is a Cadson Demak version of IBM Plex Thai (Loopless) developed by Mint Tantisuwanna–a type designer at Cadson Demak.
This project is intended for self-improvement/educational purpose.

Note: This is not a modification of IBM Plex Sans Thai. All drawings and outlines of Thai characters on this project is based solely on IBM Plex Latin.
